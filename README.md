# Code Challenge


## The two main algorithms are implemented on DistanceCalculator class

The project follows a simple MVVM architecture and focuses on creating a basic UI to support its features:

- The user can define a home city
- After defining a home city, the user can see the distance from the current selected city and the home city.
- The user can add a city to the trip
- After adding some cities to the trip, the user can then see best possible route (smallest total distance) 
by pressing the calculate route button.

## Tests
Due to time constraints, the tests were not added.
A valid strategy for this project would focus validating the functionality on the `DistanceCalculator` 
and on the `CountriesViewModel` classes.
